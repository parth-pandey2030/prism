# Prism
Prism is a programming language designed partially to make it easy to do math, as many (or all) parts of computing using math.
To set up Prism, first download a file (similar to this repo) and run:
```bash
sh shell/config.sh
```

Then, run this command to test if Prism has been installed correctly.
```bash
prism --version
```
