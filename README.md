# Prism
Prism is a programming language created by Parth Pandey in January 2024 designed partially to make it easy to do math, as all parts of computing use math.

Prism provides:
- support for easy, yet complex, mathematical computations
- a nice Julia-based plotting library

# Download and configure
If you have something like a copy of this repo, you can run:
```bash
sh shell/config.sh
```

This should get Prism ready.
