# Prism
Prism is an interpreted programming language created by Parth Pandey in January 2024 designed partially to make it easy to do math, as all parts of computing use math.

Prism provides:
- support for easy, yet complex, mathematical computations
- a nice Julia-based plotting library
- fast computation using C, C++, and Julia

# Download and configure

# Credits

The Prism logo was acquirred from [here](https://www.svgrepo.com/svg/382617/3d-shape-3d-triangle-shape-geometric-prism-pyramid-shape), however was then slightly edited.

NOTE: Some credits for individual files are inside them. For example, the credits for the JSON used in testing for the [modules/data.py](https://github.com/parth-pandey2030/prism/blob/main/modules/data.py) are written in a comment found in line 17 of the program.
